Why Parents Should not be Overprotective?
“Don’t do this beta, you will hurt yourself”!!! “OMG, my baby is upset what happened”??

Being protective of her children, we all do this as a parent now and then but being overprotective is just the opposite to that. As a parent, we want to protect the children from every negative, hateful or dangerous thing so they don’t hurt themselves and that is one of our most important responsibility as well but when do parents become overprotective? Do they realize they are being overprotective? Do they know they are not protecting but making their children vulnerable or Are they over protecting or overreacting?

Parents who are protective of their children are a blessing but overprotective parents are a curse. It does more harm to the child’s growth mentally, emotionally and physically than any good. It is said that overprotective parents are those who want to keep their children away from anything that can make them feel pain, unhappiness, failure, disappointment or rejection. These parents want their children to be successful in life and for that to happen they Lay Down all possible luxuries to make the journey comfortable for them. But what they don’t realize is that their children will become unprepared or underprepared to deal with the heartless and cruel world out there.

Parents Overprotective for thier child
Here are some ways in which you can find if you are being protective or overprotective: -
1. Comforting :- when children get hurt they call for their parents and cry out loud in pain. Comforting the child if they are hurt is Ok, but if the child falls while walking or just bump its head against anything slowly and you run to comfort them, that is being overprotective. Let the child play, run, jump or even fall sometimes as it will teach them physical endurance and also not to be overdramatic if they get a little bruise while playing.
2. Expectations :- Having reasonable expectations from a child is a good thing it helps the child to grow mentally and achieve more in life whereas over expectation is an aspect of overprotective parenting because parents just want their child to be successful in life by hook or crook so they never feel upset or disappointed which ultimately leads children to fall in depression if they do not get good scores or lives up to their parents’ expectations.

3. Competitive Environment :- Encouraging the children to compete in school/institution is a great opportunity for them to experience different emotions in one go but pressurizing the child to win the competition for a better future reference is also a trait of overprotective parenting. Parents do not want their child to deal with failure, so they pressurize their child to win at everything whereas a protective parent will let the child participate in a competition for fun and enjoyment and if the child loses also, parents will make them look to the positive side of participating.


4. Moral Laxity :-  Moral Laxity by regulating the behaviour of their children helps them learn and Respect. Rules made by their parents, school or society whereas over-pampered children who never get regulated for their behaviour or never learn to adhere to rules, start showing moral laxity in every situation of life, be it good or bad. 

Always be a role model for your child and stick to rules and respect the limits of society, because the child learns what it sees more than what is taught.

5. Reward system :-  A system of rewards for motivating is good for children but if it is left unregulated then it becomes very harmful. Parents who never let their children cry or feel upset and keep fulfilling their children’s unnecessary demands is a sign of being overprotective. Let the child earn the reward by doing something good and new every day and not for doing the regular stuff. This will make them over-pampered and eager for appreciation for every small thing they do. In the long run, they will appreciate giving and taking bribes as the studies show.

No parent is a bad parent. They all want their children to be successful and feel safe but sometimes too much care also becomes harmful for them. The parents need to understand that their children have to deal with the world someday on their own. By overprotecting the children, parents are jeopardizing their child’s growth mentally, physically, and emotionally. Let your kids move around and have exposure to true scenarios so they can learn to deal with good times and adversities in a similar manner.
